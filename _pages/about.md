intro: >
  I’m a postdoctoral researcher at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) in Genova, in the Soft Biorobotics Perception research line.  
  I build architected, monolithic soft robotic systems where structure and function are co-designed—pushing toward printable, assembly-free robots that integrate actuation and sensing in a single body.
