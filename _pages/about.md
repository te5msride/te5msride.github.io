I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)](https://www.iit.it) in Genova, advised by [Lucia Beccai](https://www.iit.it/people-details/-/people/lucia-beccai) in the [Soft Biorobotics Perception (SBRP) Lab](https://sbrp.iit.it). My current work focuses on **elephant-inspired soft robotic manipulators and monolithic systems**, exploring integrated actuation, sensing, and control for embodied intelligence in compliant robots.

Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering at the [University of North Texas](https://www.unt.edu), where I was a member of the [Advanced Robotic Manipulators (ARM) Lab](https://engineering.unt.edu/bme/research/labs/arm/) under [Amir Jafari](https://engineering.unt.edu/people/amir-jafari.html). My doctoral research investigated **thermo-active strategies for soft actuators** and **thermal variable-impedance systems**, advancing their design for safe, adaptive physical human–robot interaction. The work introduced compliant phase-change actuators and thermoelectric control approaches that improve efficiency, adaptability, and thermal responsiveness in soft robotic devices. I was an **NIH T32 Fellow** and supported through the Graduate Research Training Initiative for Student Enhancement (G-RISE) program.
