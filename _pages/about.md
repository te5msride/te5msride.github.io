Hi — I’m Trevor Exley. I design and study thermo‑active soft actuators and variable‑impedance systems for safer, more capable human–robot interaction. I’m currently a postdoc in the Soft Biorobotics Perception Research Line at IIT (Genova).

My work spans materials, actuation, and control for compliant robots, with applications to rehabilitation and assistive technologies.
