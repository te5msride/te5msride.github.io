What I did:

- Designed and characterized thermo-active impedance modulation
- Built experimental rigs and quantified force/displacement behavior
- Connected design decisions to control implications

Media to show here:

- Hero clip: stiffness change demo (loop)
- Impedance vs temperature (or force-displacement curves)
- Cross-section / control diagram
