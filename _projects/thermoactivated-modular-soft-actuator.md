summary: "Phase-transition modules enabling reconfigurable thermoactive soft actuation."
---

What I did:

- Developed modular design primitives and connection strategy
- Characterized repeatability, response time, and output forces
- Demonstrated reconfigurable behaviors via module combinations

Media to show here:

- Before/after activation (same framing)
- Module connection close-up
- System diagram of modular architecture
