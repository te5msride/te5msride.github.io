## Overview

MELEGROS is a monolithic, elephant-inspired soft gripper designed for robust grasping while providing optical sensing for contact-rich manipulation.

## What I did

- Designed the monolithic gripper morphology for stable grasps across object shapes
- Integrated optical sensing and built the acquisition + processing pipeline
- Characterized grasp behavior and sensing signatures across diverse objects

## Key idea

Combine **monolithic compliance** with **embedded optical sensing** so the gripper can both _adapt_ and _measure_ interaction without complex assembly.
