summary: "A monolithic elephant-inspired gripper integrating optical sensing for contact-rich manipulation."
---

What I did:

- Designed monolithic morphology for robust grasping
- Integrated optical sensing and built the readout pipeline
- Validated grasp behaviors + sensing signatures across objects

Media to show here:

- Hero clip: grasping varied objects (loop)
- Sensor overlay visualization during grasp
- Exploded/cutaway showing sensor placement
