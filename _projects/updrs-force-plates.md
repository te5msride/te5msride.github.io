summary: "Force-plate signals → interpretable features and models to estimate UPDRS motor symptom severity."
---

What I did:

- Built the processing + modeling pipeline from force-plate signals
- Evaluated model performance and generalization across subjects
- Focused on interpretable features aligned with motor symptom presentation

Media to show here:

- Force plate setup photo
- COP/GRF visualization (short looping clip works great)
- Pipeline diagram + key results plot
